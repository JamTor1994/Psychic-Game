# Pyschic-Game
The objective of this project was to write a program with JavaScript that would interact with users. The program generates a random letter for the user to guess.  If the user guessed correctly they would gain a win. if the user guessed incorrectly they would get a loss.  The program consists of an array which is then put into a loop to generate a letter. Such as a, there are if, else statements to make the conditions so that the user would gain wins, losses, or run out of guesses.
