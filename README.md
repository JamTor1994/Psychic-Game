# Word-Guess-Game
The idea for this project was pretty much writing a program with javascript that would interact with the user. The program would generate a random letter for the user to guess if the user guessed right they would gain a win.
If the user guessed wrong the would get a loss 
The program consists of and array which is then put into a for loop to generate a letter. Then there are if, els statments to make conditions so that the user would gain wins, losses, or run out of guesses.
